# Variables and Values to Turn Dynamic

Below is a list of variables, hardcoded values, and mock data in your codebase that should be made dynamic (i.e., fetched from a backend, database, or user input) instead of being static or placeholder values. This list is based on a scan of your codebase and may not be exhaustive, but covers the most prominent static data:

---

## src/components/HeroStatsPanel.tsx
- `totalMatches = 127;`
- `winRate = 73;`
- `ldRating = 1847;`
- `pfRating = 1632;`
- `winStreak = 5;`
- `lastEloChange = 12;`

## src/components/LiveQueueStatus.tsx
- `<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">42</p>` (Active Matches)
- `<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">127</p>` (In Queue)
- `<p className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground">892</p>` (Online)

## src/components/QuickActionButtons.tsx
- `badge: "42 Live"` (Spectate)
- `badge: "Top 100"` (Leaderboard)
- `badge: "Code"` (Join Match)

## src/pages/JoinMatch.tsx

## src/pages/Landing.tsx
- Hero section: `DebateTogether.org` (title)
- Testimonials: hardcoded testimonial text and names
- Feature cards: hardcoded feature descriptions

## src/pages/Learn.tsx
- `flashcards = [...]` (array of hardcoded flashcards)
- `drills = [...]` (array of hardcoded drills)
- `shadowDebates = [...]` (array of hardcoded shadow debates)
- Progress values in drills and skill cards

## src/pages/Leaderboard.tsx
- `leaderboardData = [...]` (array of hardcoded leaderboard entries)
- `topPerformers = [...]` (array of hardcoded top performers)

## src/pages/Profile.tsx
- `ldRating = 1847;`
- `pfRating = 1632;`
- `winStreak = 5;`
- `longestStreak = 12;`
- `recentMatches = [...]` (array of hardcoded match history)

## src/pages/Spectate.tsx
- `liveMatches = [...]` (array of hardcoded live match data)
- `chatMessages = [...]` (array of hardcoded chat messages)

## src/pages/PlayerVsAI.tsx
- `aiTypes = [...]` (array of AI judge types)
- `timeRemaining = 360;` (default speech time)
- `prepTime = 240;` (default prep time)

## src/lib/firebase.ts
- `firebaseConfig = {...}` (hardcoded Firebase credentials; should be in environment variables)

## src/components/Navbar.tsx
- `useState("JD")` (user initials default)
- Any static/fallback user profile data (e.g., avatar, name)
- Any static notification or menu items that should reflect backend/user state

**Note:**
- All the above should be replaced with dynamic data from your backend, database, or user input as appropriate.
- Some UI elements (like color tokens, Tailwind config, etc.) are meant to be static and are not included here.
- This list is a starting point; further review may be needed as you add features.
